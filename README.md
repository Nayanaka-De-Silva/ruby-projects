# ruby-projects
This repo contains a group of projects that I'm working on while learning Ruby.

All the projects have been developed using Test-Driven-Development methodology and linted using Rubocop

The projects themselves are a challenge to help design better code. 
The structure of the project folders have been carefully thought out to provide the best solution to the given problem.
